# Machine Learning Weekly

Welcome to Machine Learning Weekly! This repository is dedicated to documenting my weekly progress as I dive deep into advanced topics in Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). The focus is on Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP), with the goal of completing at least two projects every week.

## Goals

1. Master Advanced ML/AI Concepts: Build expertise in state-of-the-art techniques.
2. Hands-On Learning: Complete two projects weekly to reinforce theoretical knowledge.
3. Career Preparation: Develop a strong portfolio for career opportunities.
4. Startup Product Building: Create reusable modules and ideas for future startups.

## Tools and Frameworks

- Programming Languages: Python
- Libraries: TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Specialized Tools: TensorFlow Serving, Docker, MLflow

## Portfolio and Documentation

All projects are organized in this repository with:

- Code: Clean, modular, and reusable.
- Documentation: Detailed explanations of models, techniques, and results.
- Visualizations: Graphs, charts, and other insights.
- Deployment: MLOps-ready pipelines for easy implementation.
